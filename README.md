This repository is part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). This [project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/associations) utilizes Ruby on Rails to build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which enables users to create events and send invitations. The site has been styled through the use of Bootstrap and borrows from the Hartl Tutorial's CSS code. This site has been deployed to Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://fierce-headland-7201.herokuapp.com/).
