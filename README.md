This repository is part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com). This [project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/associations) utilizes Ruby on Rails to build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which enables users to create events and send invitations. The site has been styled through the use of Bootstrap and borrows from the Hartl Tutorial's CSS code.
